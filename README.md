<h1 align="center"> Hangman python game! </h1>

[View the live project here.](https://github.com/EbbaStrandholm/milestone-project-3)

This is a simple python project created to make a hangman game. However I didn't manage to solve the problems that arised in time, so instead of not handing anything in I decided to hand in what I do have, for a chance at redoing this for "only" a pass in grade

## User Experience (UX)

    - I want the game to work for those who run it, just as simple as hangman can get really. There are six lives in total, and when all the guesses has been used you will either loose or win the game, depending on if you completed the word or not.

-   ### Design
    - there really is not any design to this project as I simply only used python due to time restraints. It is a simple game that runs in the terminal of the code

## Technologies Used

    - there is an array in hangmanwords.py that is imported into the game.py file, in order to keep it more clean looking

### Languages Used

-   Python

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used to commit and later on push the code to github
1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects after having been pushed from git
1. [pygame:](https://www.pygame.org/news)
    - pygame was installed for this project

## Testing

- I tried to debug my code to no avail, so instead of not handing anything in I will be handing in what I do have.
- The code was tested using PEP8, there are some warnings but I got no notification of a known error when tested

### Known Bugs

-   the game shows the first hangman drawing, but no letter can be inputted, and hence the game sadly doesn't run as I had wished

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Locate [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/EbbaStrandholm/milestone-project-3)
2. At the top of this Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page, there you will locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "main".
5. Refresh the page and a link will have shown up in the settings' pages section.
6. press the link and you will be brought to 

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and find the github repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not the page) right above "Settings" on the menu, there is a "Fork" Button.
3. Now you should also have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
